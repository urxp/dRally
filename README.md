# dRally

The main goal of this project is to create a port of Death Rally (1996) running natively on Linux and BSD based operating systems.

#### Linux requirements
* GCC/Clang C compiler
* GNU/Make
* SDL2


#### Building

```sh
FLAGS="YOUR CFLAGS" make
```

#### Installation - needs original game assets

* [Death Rally registered free windows version CHIP](https://www.chip.de/downloads/Death-Rally-Vollversion_38550689.html)

```sh
7z e -o drally DeathRallyWin_10.exe
cd drally && mkdir CINEM && mv ENDANI* CINEM && mv SANIM* CINEM
echo "./CINEM" &> CDROM.INI
```

Only versions including the DR.IDF file are able to use the `FLAGS += -DDR_CDCHECK`
